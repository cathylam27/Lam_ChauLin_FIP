# The Final Integrated Project
This is my Final Integrated Project for winter term.

# What we need to do
We need to complete the FIP requirement with a repository and some branches for a project and upload it to Github, then all folders and files need to though Pull Requests to merge to main branch, and submit the project link to FOL.
